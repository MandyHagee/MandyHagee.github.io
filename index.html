	<h2>June 27th: people card rough cut + something digital that is also cool</h2>

	<h4>I'm confused about some things with this people card situation (surprise, surprise!), but the link to my CodePen is <a href="http://codepen.io/mandyhagee/pen/rLjRVR">right here</a>.<br></br>

	And <a href="url" src="https://vimeo.com/65102146">here</a> is a cool thing that I find hilarious. This is a few years old, but when it first came out I watched it about a dozen times within a couple of days. Obviously it's funny how amused the narrator is by her own story, but I think the animator does a great job of highlighting the absurdity of the joke and of the narrator's intoxication (such as the vaudeville-esque music, the slight rippling of the art, and the slight confusion on the faces of the chips when the schoolyard pops up around them). Enjoy!
