	<h2>June 27th: people card rough cut + something digital that is also cool</h2>

	<h4>I'm confused about some things with this people card situation (surprise, surprise!), but the link to my CodePen is <a href="http://codepen.io/mandyhagee/pen/rLjRVR">right here</a>.<br></br>

	And <a href="url" src="https://vimeo.com/65102146">here</a> is a cool thing that I find hilarious. This is a few years old, but when it first came out I watched it about a dozen times within a couple of days. Obviously it's funny how amused the narrator is by her own story, but I think the animator does a great job of highlighting the absurdity of the joke and of the narrator's intoxication (such as the vaudeville-esque music, the slight rippling of the art, and the slight confusion on the faces of the chips when the schoolyard pops up around them). Enjoy!

		<h2>July 5th: attempting to talk meaningfully about my project</h2>

		<h4>
			
		<b>What is your project?</b> Good question! Because my final career goals revolve around Instructional Design, I feel like some sort of educational product would make sense. What does that entail, though? One version might include a short instructional animation followed by a short multiple-choice quiz.<br>
		Another version might be a <ul>much</ul> simpler version of the pomes project--meaning, you click on an icon or photo or whatever, and a text box or an audio recording or similar would activate.<br>
		Would either of these be possible for a novice like me to create from scratch? Could I instead modify a template?<br>
		<b>Who is its audience, and what do they value?</b>n I haven't determined by target audience, as you may have already guessed. Really it could be anyone who is looking to learn. At this point it seems likely that, assuming I do end up in ID, I will be working primarily with/for adult learners--though whether in professional development or continuing education or corporate training, I don't know (seems option #2 is most likely). Regardless, efficiency would be very valuable, as I envision targeting people with full-time jobs and families. They value the ability to stay engaged enough to process the material without having to expend excessive amounts of time and energy.<br>
		<b>How will you know if it is successful?</b> I have absolutely no idea how I'll know whether it's successful other than by the most basic requirements: aesthetically pleasing, it <ul>works</ul>, ya know... that sort of thing. I suppose I could test it on someone outside of the class and see if it's "successful" in anyone else's view but mine.<br>
		<b>What is your plan for going about it?</b> Another question I don't know the answer to! There's really no way for me to accomplish any of this without using a lot of animation, which seems a little crazy to me as a beginner. I may use Scratch again--really I'm not sure I have a choice. Even Scratch may not be sophisticated enough for the level of interactivity in mind, although I haven't messed around with it enough to really know for sure. I may be underestimating its power.<br>
		I'm having a hard time thinking of a way to scale this back to a more manageable coding level, probably mostly because I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, so there's not much to build on. <ul>BAH!!</ul>
